       <p>❝When you forgive, you in no way change the past - but you sure do change the future.❞ <br />
                <em> ― Bernard Meltzer </em></p>
        

        <h3>Three upcoming challenges I'll face in the future;</h3>
        
            <p style="font-size: 14px">
              
                ✧ One current and upcoming challenge is what exactly I want to do in life. I love the idea of it being Web Design, Graphic Design and Video Editing but sometimes I wonder if that's EXACTLY what I want. It's a great major to do and while it seems fun and interesting, it's also something to be taken seriously. I can't simply persue it because it's "fun". The way I want to get over this challenge is by finding my drive and finding ways to encourage myself to learn everything about Web designing and everything that comes with it. I want to attain a skill that I'm both good at and that I enjoy putting into practice. 
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 14px">
              
                ❁ Another challenge I'm currently facing is how to get over my nerves and learn to drive properly. I want to be a safe driver but in order to do that I can't be nervous about driving and concertrate on what I'm doing. The way I want to tackle this challenge is by looking for places that teach new drivers how to drive properly. Once I get use to driving and get comfortable with being behind the wheel, I won't be nervous.

            <p style="font-size: 14px">
              
                ❀ The last challenging upcoming moment is the courses I'll be taking and to do better than I did this semester. I had good grades this semester, but I'd also like to do even better. I'd like to finish next semester with 85's or higher. This means I have to try harder and push myself to better myself.
