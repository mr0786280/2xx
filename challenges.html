        <p>❝When we are no longer able to change a situation, we are challenged to change ourselves.❞ <br />
                <em> ― Viktor Frankl </em></p>
        
        <h3>Three challenges I've faced in the past;</h3>
        
            <p style="font-size: 14px">
              
                ✶ One thing I've faced as a challenge in life would have to be the separation between my parents. When I was in the 6th grade, something terrible happened between them and they could no longer be together. This didn't have a positive effect on me or my brother and it put me in depression. I've since been going to therapy and with time, it doesn't really hurt as much but I still think about it and it makes me upset a bit.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 14px">
              
                ❃ Another challenge, as cliché as this sounds, high school was actually a challenge I'm very glad I got through. I didn't really have a good high school experience so moving and onto college and starting anew is much better. Here I get to meet new people and even get better grades than what I had in high school. 
            </p>
        
            <p style="font-size: 14px">
              
                ☼ The last challenging moment in life is facing depression and anxiety. In life, I go through moments where I feel no energy, where I feel like I'm absolutely worthless and matter to no one, where I believe that it's better if I weren't alive and I feel no motivation to do anything I'm supposed to do. I feel empty and I tend to put myself down and hurt myself with things I think to myself (never physically though). Usually, to get myself out of this I try to cheer myself up and doing something that would usually make me happy or talk to someone about it. 
            </p>
         <h3>Three upcoming challenges I'll face in the future;</h3>
        
            <p style="font-size: 14px">
              
                ✧ One current and upcoming challenge is what exactly I want to do in life. I love the idea of it being Web Design, Graphic Design and Video Editing but sometimes I wonder if that's EXACTLY what I want. It's a great major to do and while it seems fun and interesting, it's also something to be taken seriously. I can't simply persue it because it's "fun". The way I want to get over this challenge is by finding my drive and finding ways to encourage myself to learn everything about Web designing and everything that comes with it. I want to attain a skill that I'm both good at and that I enjoy putting into practice. 
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 14px">
              
                ❁ Another challenge I'm currently facing is how to get over my nerves and learn to drive properly. I want to be a safe driver but in order to do that I can't be nervous about driving and concertrate on what I'm doing. The way I want to tackle this challenge is by looking for places that teach new drivers how to drive properly. Once I get use to driving and get comfortable with being behind the wheel, I won't be nervous. 
            </p>
        
            <p style="font-size: 14px">
              
                ❀ The last challenging upcoming moment is the courses I'll be taking and to do better than I did this semester. I had good grades this semester, but I'd also like to do even better. I'd like to finish next semester with 85's or higher. This means I have to try harder and push myself to better myself.
